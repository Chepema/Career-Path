Career Path

Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub repository, Career Path. My name is José María Bolaños Corredera, and this space is where I document my journey as I transition into the field of Data Science. This repository is more than just a collection of code—it’s a reflection of my personal and professional growth, my diverse experiences, and my relentless curiosity. Here, you’ll find projects, experiments, and insights that showcase my skills and my passion for solving complex problems.

My Story

Early Curiosity and Tech Savviness

My journey into technology began early. As a child, my uncle introduced me to an MS-DOS computer, sparking a lifelong curiosity. With my parents running an audiovisual rental business, I had access to equipment that most kids my age didn’t. But instead of just playing with these tools, I wanted to understand how they worked. I became the kid who disassembled appliances—not because they were broken, but because I needed to understand their inner workings. Sometimes, I managed to put them back together, even improving them in my own way, despite having no formal training. These experiences, combined with countless hours spent playing with Legos, laid the foundation for a lifelong passion for technology and problem-solving.

A Lifelong Love for Music and Adaptability

Music has always been a significant part of my life. At nine, I began playing guitar, but my initial lack of discipline meant I didn’t make much progress. However, my love for heavier music led me to pick up the bass guitar, and with determination, I learned to play “Hotel California” to prove a point to my parents. My musical journey has been anything but smooth—an accident in 2008 severely injured my left wrist, making it difficult to play. But instead of giving up, I adapted. Being left-handed, I taught myself to play the bass left-handed, starting from scratch. This perseverance led to the formation of my band, Shadow Corvus. Though the pain eventually forced me to stop playing consistently, my love for music persisted, leading me to Mexico in 2012 to pursue a career in Audio Engineering and Music Production.

In Mexico, I immersed myself in the world of music production, working as a recording engineer, producing live concerts, and running my own recording studio. I had the privilege of working with a variety of genres—from punk to reggaeton—allowing me to explore the full spectrum of musical creativity. But despite the success, I realized I wasn’t building something sustainable, which led me to shift gears once again.

Creative Ventures and Professional Growth

My career then took me into event and film production. I worked on TV ads, documentaries, and even feature films, contributing to projects like “La Pasión de Nella Barrantes” and a Falabella Chile ad with Gisele Bündchen. These experiences taught me the importance of creativity, persistence, and the value of hard work. However, the instability of this work drove me to explore more stable career paths, including Project Management and Scrum.

Throughout my professional journey, I’ve worn many different hats—network technician, customer service agent, sales representative, billboard printer and installer, meat smoker, event producer, music producer, recording engineer, runner, production assistant, construction worker, and more recently, tech support agent. Each role has shaped me into a versatile problem solver, with experiences ranging from producing large televised events to developing systems that transformed small operations into multimillion-dollar enterprises. These diverse experiences have honed my ability to adapt quickly and solve complex problems, often in situations where there seemed to be no clear answer.

The Academic Journey and Lifelong Learning

My academic journey has been anything but linear. I was accepted into the Industrial Maintenance program at the Technological Institute of Costa Rica, only to switch to Electrical Engineering at the University of Costa Rica. After three years, I realized I wasn’t fully committed to this path and left to pursue my passion for music in Mexico. In 2020, I tried studying Business Administration to complement my Project Management skills, but the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted my plans. Despite these setbacks, I never stopped learning. I’ve pursued various certifications, including Lean Six Sigma (White & Yellow Belt), Python Programming, Design Thinking Professional, and Project Management, continuously seeking out new challenges and opportunities to grow.

A New Chapter: Data Science

Now, at 33, with two children and a renewed sense of purpose, I’ve decided to fully commit to a path that aligns with my passions and skills. I’ve earned a scholarship to study Data Science Engineering at Lead University, a field that perfectly suits my curiosity and technical background. Data science represents the perfect convergence of my interests in technology, problem-solving, and creativity. My goal is to build a career in this field that leverages all my past experiences while providing stability and growth opportunities for my family.
